Right so this is what we did: 

First we needed something cool, something that would show the world who we are. Something that would make people turn their heads and go "Wow, whoever made this website must be the most radical dude whoever coded, yo." 

And so we made a D&D website. 

But not just any D&D website. No. We could have done something actually useful, like a means of helping new players pick a race/class combo. Or even something to help DMs design a campaign. 

We decided to tally how many times players sucked so bad they died. 

Here's how we did it. First, after a fierce debate on what our topic should be. It was a valiant debate. Foul words were cast and allegiance made and broken. But in the end we found a public API that had a list of all the monsters in D&D with a bunch of information about them. Most of which, kinda irrelevant. But whatever. We just decided to make that a part of the site anyway. 

Then we divided up the workload. Alex became known as Sir Alex of the CSS, who bravely battled the part of the code each of us feared the most. The wily Brody, the great general of the company who kept the party focused while himself doing battle with the json. And Joe the Form-Weaver who set about the task of filling out the code to bring forth the visage of foul monsters and render the lists of the fallen alike. 

With their powers combined they created vaniqueshed the challenges they faced and brought to the world the desired website with the following functions:

1) Through typing in the name of a monster the beast would be revealed in name along with a brief description and image. 

2) Should it behoove you to learn more about these vile creatures, pressing the Details button would deliver to all who wish it the information needed to defend themselves from their enemy. 

3) The Death button, placed below the visage of the monstrocity, which would tally how many valiant heroes perished facing it. 

4) The Button of Chance and Misfortune, to call upon the fates to bring a new vicious challenge to face. 

Upon completing these labours, our heroes looked about with confusion. Was this all? Was there no more they could do? 

"Nay," exclaimed Brody. "For there is more we could do to honor our fallen."

And together they set about themselves toiling to dig a graveyard. Etching the names of the lost brave among the stones, so that a trophy would be placed for each that was slain by the selected monster.
